While this dissertation bears my name as the author, it is the outcome of many people's direct and indirect efforts. First, much gratitude to my supervisor [`Professor Kalu Ojah`](https://www.wits.ac.za/staff/academic-a-z-listing/o/kaluojahwitsacza/) without whose intellectual and material input, it would have been impossible to get this far. From the procurement of data and conferences to painstakingly reading through my work (even when the fonts were tiny), I learned a lot from Professor Ojah. Moreover, I thank my research proposal panellists for providing critical input: Dr Jones Mensah, Professor Chris Malikane, and Dr Diran Soumonni.  

Further, much gratitude to the leaders of organizations that have partially funded this research; `The Bradlow Foundation`, [`BANKSETA`](https://www.bankseta.org.za/), and the [`AERC`](https://aercafrica.org). Special thanks to `Karatina University` for granting a four year paid study leave. I also appreciate `Wits University` for support through the PMA award and offering a conducive research environment. 

Many thanks to my family, especially my parents and siblings to whom this work is dedicated (see dedication), for understanding during the many months I was away. Gratitude to residents of `76 Long Street` - Muchiri Githiria, Eddy Ombagi, Luicer Ingasia, Wycliffe Nduga, Simon Kamau, George Kariuki, Job Mwaura, Wycliffe Oluoch and Felix Mutunga. I will never forget that wonderful trip to `Maputo, Mozambique`, and the great moments in Bloemfontein, Brits, Gaborone, Durban, Margate, and Mahikeng. The nights at the `Blind PIG` and 7th Street `Melville` are worth the memories.  

Credit to the people at the [`R` Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) for availing of such a beautiful data analysis software without subscription fees. I appreciate ALL the people at [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) and Hadley Wickham for originating the Tidyverse, thereby making data analysis palatable, accessible, and even, at times, fun. These gratitudes should extend to the entire open source community - I have even switched to [`Linux`](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). Finally, I thank [`EdX`](https://www.edx.org/) for funding the `Professional Certificate in Data Science` and `15.071x: The Analytics Edge` courses that changed my approach and attitude towards data analysis. Credit to anyone else I may have omitted; a page can only go so far.
